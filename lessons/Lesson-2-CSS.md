Let's learn a little bit more about CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets. CSS is the language we use to style an HTML document.

This is a great tutorial about how to implement CSS: 

CSS sets rules or parameters on how different objects on a web page should be styled. These objects are created using HTML (e.g., `body` or `h1` are specific elements on a page, where `para1` could be an ID of a specific element).

CSS allows you to get creative on how different elements are rendered using rules like:
* `color`
* `text-align`
* `border-style`

Think about it this way...you are styling your webpage the same as you would do in Microsoft Word or Google Docs...just with code.

Go to [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp) tutorial on HTML to play around a bit to learn more about CSS.

Once you have played around a bit, go to `spark.js` in your copy of the code and scroll down until you see `var buildingsStyle = ...`. Here is where we are setting the parameters for the building features that are loaded into the map view. The `color` uses [Color Hex Codes](https://www.color-hex.com/). Change the buildings style using different color codes, weights, and opacity to see what the results look like. If you are using your own data from Overpass and know what building types are being downloaded, change many styles and be creative!
